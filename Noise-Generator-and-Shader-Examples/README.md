# Noise Generator and Shader Examples

This is a Godot 3.2 project containing two scenes:

Seamless noise generator scene - Here you can setup a noise texture, play around with its parameters and save the texture as a png (will be saved to the /capture/ folder).

Shader example scene - Here you'll find three example uses of noise in a 2D shader. It's not too crazy, just very simple examples to spark imagination.


## How to use?

Best is to watch the YouTube video (link following after upload) explaining the creation of this example project, the generator and the combination process of different noise textures.
